# Production Gaps Report

Repo-wide scan for mock/sim/stub/placeholder/NotImplementedError/SECRET_KEY usage.

Command used:

```bash
rg -n "mock|simulate|simulator|stub|placeholder|NotImplementedError|SECRET_KEY|TENSORGUARD_ENCRYPTED_UPDATE_V2"
```

## Summary

- Production scope entries require remediation or fail-closed gating before production deployment.
- Non-production entries (docs/tests/demo/bench) are listed for completeness and must remain excluded from distribution builds.
